== Purpose

This repo accompanies my session titled *"AI 202: Next-level Mastery for Java Developers"* and includes the code written within the session and much more. Please star+watch to be notified of updates, as there will be _many_.

== Related presentation

One may be forthcoming, but this session was designed to be 99% code. So please star+watch the repo and drop me a line if you'd like to see some slides accompany this. That way, you'll be notified once a repo link is added, code changes, etc. All the good stuff. :) Cheers!
